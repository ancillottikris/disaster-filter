    <div class="container">
      <p>Scores of natural disasters slammed the U.S. in 2018, and with them came hefty price tags. Disasters like the Camp Fire, Hurricane Florence and the bomb cyclone that swept through the East Coast last January together racked up
        estimated costs of over $75 billion. </p>

      <p>Year after year, natural disasters like fires, flooding and snow storms have ravaged states across the country. These events pose two interesting questions: Who pays for all this rebuilding? And at what point is it no longer
        economically feasible to do so?</p>

      <p>When rebuilding after natural disasters, "More money was often spent on the repairs than the properties themselves were actually worth," said Andrea McCardle, a professor at the CUNY School of Law and an expert on urban land use. </p>

      <p>Much of the money for rebuilding comes from the Federal Emergency Management Administration, or FEMA, which disburses funds to states when they declare a state of emergency. FEMA's funding comes from taxes paid by all Americans,
        regardless of whether or not they are individually affected by natural disasters. </p>

      <p>While there were several high-profile, costly disasters in 2018, there were many more weather-related incidents that didn’t make the headlines. </p>

      <p>Overall, there were 59 natural disaster declarations across 33 states. Use the filter below to see where these disasters occurred and what type of weather emergency affected each state. </p>

      <p>While some people do leave their homes permanently after a natural disaster, many stay and choose to rebuild, despite the risk of disaster striking again. </p>

      <p>"Some people are just attached," McCardle said. "There's a real attachment to the land and the sense of place, and so people are generally reluctant to move."</p>

      <p>Robert Moran, a resident of Breezy Point, New York for the last six years, had his home destroyed due to flood damage from Hurricane Sandy, and narrowly missed the fire that engulfed his neighbors’ homes only a few blocks away. And yet,
        he
        never considered relocating. </p>

      <p>"After Sandy, I knew I was rebuilding and staying," Moran said. "The reward outweighs the risk." He highlighted the tight-knit community as a major reason for staying.</p>

      <p>"It's a great place to raise kids," he said. </p>

      <p>Moran didn't have flood insurance when Hurricane Sandy hit. He chose to take out a personal loan to rebuild rather than take a grant from FEMA, due to complications in the filing process.</p>

      <p>However, many other people do accept FEMA disbursements, and who pays for those grants is a complicated question. </p>

      <p>According to Amir Jina, an environmental and development economist at the University of Chicago, it's an interconnected web of transfer payments which are not paid for only by the individuals who live in the disaster area. </p>

      <p>"In terms of who's bearing the brunt of paying back for this, it's not just the local level," Jina said. "The costs are generally shared, much more so than we anticipate. So when something happens in Florida, it's not just Florida paying
        for it. It's the whole country."</p>
